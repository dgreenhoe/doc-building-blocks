                  Many many thanks to Po-Ning Chen (Chinese: \zht{陳伯寧}, pinyin: Ch/'en B/'o Ni/'ng) for his consultation with regards to the translation of the book title:
                  ``\zht{鑑} means book in ancient Chinese. 
                  For example, \zht{資治通鑑} is a famous history book. 
                  Usually, it means a book with serious subject. 
                  \zht{玉} is a precious stone in Chinese, which can be translated as Jade.
                  So I guess 
                  The Jade Mirror of Four Unknowns
                  is a good translation because 'Mirror' means a 'faithful recording/book of something.'"---Po-Ning Chen \zht{陳伯寧}, 2012 September 12)},

                  Many many thanks to Po-Ning Chen (Chinese: \zht{陳伯寧}, pinyin: Ch/'en B/'o Ni/'ng) for his consultation with regards to the translation of the book title:
                  ``Originally, '\zht{鑑}' is a basin or container made by metals. 
                  It can then be used as a mirror after pouring water into it, 
                  and hence is extended to indicate a book that reflects faithfully about a subject. 
                  '\zht{玉}' is a precious stone and hence can be translated as Jade. 
                  The combination of the two characters is therefore translated as 'The Jade Mirror'."---Po-Ning Chen (\zht{陳伯寧}), 2012 September 12)},
