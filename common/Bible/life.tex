  {The geometric calculus, in general, 
   consists in a system of operations on geometric entities, and their consequences, 
   analogous to those that algebra has on the numbers.
   It permits the expression in formulas of the results of geometric constructions,
   the representation with equations of propositions of geometry,
   and the substitution of a transformation of equations for a verbal argument.}

%  {But it seems to me that in spite of the word-mastery of the metaphysicians,
%   we know really too little, or even nothing at all,
%   about the true nature of space to be able to confuse something that seems
%   unnatural with absolutely impossible.
%   If non-Euclidean geometry is the real one and the constant is incomparable
%   to the magnitudes that we encounter on earth or in the heavens then it can be
%   determined aposteriori.
%   I have therefore occasionally for fun expressed the wish that Euclidean geometry
%   not be the real one, for then we would have a priori an absolute measure.}

  \item Life comes from God:
    \\
    ``Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground,
    and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
    and man became a living being."  Genesis 2:7 NASB
   \\
   ``See now that I, I am He, And there is no god besides Me; It is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded and it is I who heal, And there is no one who can deliver from My hand."
   Deuteronomy 32:39 NASB
    \\
    ``The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life."
    Job 33:4 NASB

  \item Life is in the blood:
    \\
    ``For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls ; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement."
    Leviticus 17:11 NASB
    \\
    ``Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood." Genesis 9:4 NASB
    \\
    ``For as for the life of all flesh, its blood is identified with its life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, 'You are not to eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood ; whoever eats it shall be cut off."
    Leviticus 17:14 NASB
    \\
    ``Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the life, 
     and you shall not eat the life with the flesh."
    Deuteronomy 12:23 NASB
    \\
    ``He will rescue their life from oppression and violence, And their blood will be precious in his sight;"
    Psalms 72:14 NASB
    \\ 
    ``He heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning ; his blood will be on himself. But had he taken warning, he would have delivered his life."
    Ezekiel 35:5 NASB
