  {You know that I write slowly.
    This is chiefly because I am never satisfied until I have said as much as
    possible in a few words,
    and writing briefly takes far more time than writing at length.}

%Aubrey, John (1626-1697)
%[About Thomas Hobbes:]
%He was 40 years old before he looked on geometry; which happened accidentally. Being in a gentleman's library, Euclid's Elements lay open, and "twas the 47 El. libri I" [Pythagoras' Theorem]. He read the proposition . "By God", sayd he, "this is impossible:" So he reads the demonstration of it, which referred him back to such a proposition; which proposition he read. That referred him back to another, which he also read. Et sic deinceps, that at last he was demonstratively convinced of that trueth. This made him in love with geometry.

This book is largely based on four papers written by the same author as this text:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \citeP{greenhoe2015sto}: \emph{Order and metric geometry compatible stochastic processing}.
    \\\url{https://peerj.com/preprints/844/}
    \\\url{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303057738}
    \\This paper is the basis for \pref{chp:sto}.
  \item \citeP{greenhoe2015ssp}: \emph{Order and Metric Compatible Symbolic Sequence Processing}.
    \\\url{https://peerj.com/preprints/2052/}
    \\\url{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302947227}
    \\This paper is the basis for \pref{chp:ssp}.
    \\The C++ source code used to generate the 128 or so TeX files for the data plots in the paper can be downloaded from here:
