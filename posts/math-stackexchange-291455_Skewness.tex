$\newcommand{\pP}{P}$
To be sure, the estimated skewness equal to zero (which implies symmetry) of the asymmetric sequence _does_ tend to give one pause.
However, the key distinction here is  
(1) The sequence of samples $[1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5,\,6,\,7,\,8,\,9]$ as a _time series_ is **asymmetric**.  
(2) The assumed _probability density function_ ([pdf](https://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:MATH105_Probability/Lesson_1_DRV/1.03_The_Discrete_PDF))
that the samples are drawn from is **symmetric**.

Elaborating on (2), note that there is exactly one $1$, one $2$, one $3$, $\cdots$, one $9$.
As such, under the assumption that the pdf is [_stationary_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process)
over the time period during which the nine samples were drawn,
a crude [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) of that pdf is simply
$\pP(1)=\pP(2)=\pP(3)=\cdots=\pP(9)=\frac{1}{9}$,
which is _symmetric_ about $5$.
