    As the quote demonstrates, Fourier's essay was quite controversial and Lagrange was 
    successful in effectively blocking its publication.\footnotemark  % see Hawking page 524

  %{Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret analogies that unite them.}
  {%
  The analytical equations
  \ldots
  %, unknown to the ancient geometers, which Descartes was the first to introduce into the study of curves and surfaces, 
  %are not restricted to the properties of figures, and to 
  %those properties which are the object of rational mechanics ; they 
  extend to all general phenomena. 
  There cannot be a language more universal and more simple, 
  more free from errors and from obscurities, 
  \ldots
  %that is to say more worthy to express the invariable relations of natural things. 
  
  %Considered from this point of view, 
  mathematical analysis is as extensive as nature itself; 
  \ldots
  %it defines all perceptible relations, measures times, spaces, forces, temperatures ; 
  %this difficult science is formed slowly, but 
  it preserves every principle which it has once acquired; 
  it grows and strengthens itself incessantly in the midst of the many variations and errors of the human mind. 
  Its chief attribute is clearness; it has no marks to express confused notions. 
  It brings together phenomena the most diverse, and discovers the hidden analogies which unite them.
