\begin{abstract}
The literature offers varying and in general incompatible definitions of the
\fncte{cross-correlation} function $\Rxy(n,m)$ and its \ope{jointly wide-sense stationary} special case $\Rxy(m)$.
The choice of definition has consequences for results involving the \fncte{cross-spectral density} function 
$\Swxy(\omega)$, and the more general Z-transform density $\Szxy(z)$.

The literature offers varying and in general incompatible definitions of the cross-correlation functions Rxy(n,m) and its jointly wide-sense stationary special case Rxy(m). The choice of definition has consequences for results involving the cross-spectral density function Sxy(w), and the more general Z-transform density Sxy(z).
