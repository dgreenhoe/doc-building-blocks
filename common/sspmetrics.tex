\subsection{Motivation}
%=======================================
Why might we care about \fncte{metric}s, or more generally \fncte{distance function}s, 
in symbolic sequence processing?
\structe{Metric ball}s in a \structe{metric space} induce a \structe{topology}. 
Topologies are necessary for the concept of \prope{convergence}.
Some topologies are also \structe{algebra of set}s;\footnote{For example 
  on the three element set $\setn{x,y,z}$, there are a total of 29 topologies;
  on of these 29, five are algebras of sets. % (see \prefp{ex:set_lat_top_xyz}).

an algebra of sets (or in particular a \structe{sigma-algebra}) is used for the concept of measure.
Loosely speaking then, we care about \fncte{distance} and \structe{distance space}s for two reasons:
\begin{enume}
  \item In analysis, \structe{metric space}s allow us to define the concepts of convergence and limit of a sequence as in
   $\sum_{n=0}^\infty x_n \eqd \lim_{\xN\to\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{n=\xN} x_n$.
   That is, without the implicit or explicit definition of convergence and limit, the expression 
   $\sum_{n=0}^\infty x_n$ is meaningless.\footnote{

  %When dealing with finite sequences, such as DNA sequences, the definition of a convergence and limit is less important.\footnote{
  %However, note that when processing a finite sequence using real digital hardware, 
  %convergence is still important.
  %This is especially true when the processing algorithm involves feedback (such as in an IIR filter)
  %implemented on a fixed point arithmetic processing hardware (such as is used in several DSP processors).}

  \item In signal processing, ``optimal" decisions may be made with respect to a \structe{distance space}.
    For example, a point may be selected (identified as ``optimal") based on it being measured as having the smallest distance
    to some reference point. 
    %Note that if convergence is not required for the system, then 
    %a \structe{distance space} \xref{def:distance}, 
    %rather the more restrictive \structe{metric space}, may be sufficient.
\end{enume}
