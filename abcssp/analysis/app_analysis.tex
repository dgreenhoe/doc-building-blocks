  {Dirichlet alone, not I, nor Cauchy, nor Gauss knows what a completely rigorous proof is.
   Rather we learn it first from him.
   When Gauss says he has proved something it is clear;
   when Cauchy says it, one can wager as much pro as con;
   when Dirichlet says it, it is certain.}
  %{Dirichlet alone, not I, nor Cauchy, nor Gauss knows what a completely rigorous proof is,

  % When Gauss says he has proved something, it is very probable to me;
  % when Cauchy says it, it is more likely than not,
  % when Dirichlet says it, it is \emph{proved}.}
