\begin{abstract}
The literature offers varying and in general incompatible definitions of the
\fncte{cross-correlation} function $\Rxy(n,m)$ and its \ope{jointly wide-sense stationary} special case $\Rxy(m)$.
The choice of definition has consequences for results involving the \fncte{cross-spectral density} function 
$\Swxy(\omega)$, and the more general Z-transform density $\Szxy(z)$.
In some stochastic processing systems involving simple additive noise or even additive noise
combined with non-linear operations, these varying definitions lead to identical results.
In some other systems involving nonlinear and linear parallel operations, 
including those involving system identification problems,
results differ.

The literature offers varying and in general incompatible definitions of the cross-correlation functions Rxy(n,m) and its jointly wide-sense stationary special case Rxy(m). The choice of definition has consequences for results involving the cross-spectral density function Sxy(w), and the more general Z-transform density Sxy(z). In some stochastic processing systems involving simple additive noise or even additive noise combined with non-linear operations, these varying definitions lead to identical results. In some other systems involving nonlinear and linear parallel operations, including some involving system identification problems, results differ.
