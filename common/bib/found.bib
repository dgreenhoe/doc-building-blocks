                  there is a homeomorphic copy on the same set that is a complement
                  in the lattice of topologies on X.
                  The problem of characterizing finite self complementary topologies
                  leads us to redefine the problem in terms of
                  preorders (i.e. reflexive, transitive relations).
                  A preorder P on a set X is self complementary
                  if there is an isomorphic copy P' of P on X that is arc disjoint
                  to P (except for loops) and with the property that P\cup P' is
                  strongly connected.
                  We characterize here self complementary finite partial orders
                  and self complementary finite equivalence relations.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy logic methods have been used successfully in many real-world applications, but the foundations of fuzzy logic remain under attack. Taken together, these two facts constitute a paradox. A second paradox is that almost all of the successful fuzzy logic applications are embedded controllers, while most of the theoretical papers on fuzzy methods deal with knowledge representation and reasoning. I hope to resolve these paradoxes by identifying which aspects of fuzzy logic render it useful in practice, and which aspects are inessential. My conclusions are based on a mathematical result, on a survey of literature on the use of fuzzy logic in heuristic control and in expert systems, and on practical experience in developing expert systems.},

In 1940 Alfred Tarski proposed an axiomatization for a large part of the calculus of relations. In the next decade Tarski's axiomatization led to the creation of the theory of relation algebras, and was shown to be incomplete by Roger Lyndon's discovery of nonrepresentable relation algebras. This paper introduces the calculus of relations and the theory of relation algebras through a review of these historical developments.},

  abstract     = {The theory of inconsistency has been growing steadily over the last two decades. One focus has been philosophical issues arising from the paradoxes of set theory and semantics. A second focus has been the study of paraconsistent or inconsistency-tolerant logics. A third focus has been the application of paraconsistent logics to problems in artificial intelligence. This book focuses on a fourth aspect: the construction of mathematical theories in which contradictions occur, and the investigation of their properties. The inconsistent approach provides a distinctive perspective on the various number systems, order differential and integral calculus, discontinuous changes, inconsistent systems of linear equations, projective geometry, topology and category theory. The final chapter outlines several known results concerning paradoxes in the foundations of set theory and semantics. The book begins with an informal chapter which summarises the main results nontechnically, and draws philosophical implications from them.
                  This volume will be of interest to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and professionals in the areas of logic, philosophy, mathematics and theoretical computer science.},

                  now seems illusory. No useful criterion for ranking identities by interest
                  and importance has emerged. The identities, both old and new, seem to lose

                  Many many thanks to Po-Ning Chen (Chinese: \zht{陳伯寧}, pinyin: Ch/'en B/'o Ni/'ng) for his consultation with regards to the translation of the book title:
                  ``\zht{鑑} means book in ancient Chinese. 
                  For example, \zht{資治通鑑} is a famous history book. 
                  Usually, it means a book with serious subject. 
                  \zht{玉} is a precious stone in Chinese, which can be translated as Jade.
                  So I guess 
                  The Jade Mirror of Four Unknowns
                  is a good translation because 'Mirror' means a 'faithful recording/book of something.'"---Po-Ning Chen \zht{陳伯寧}, 2012 September 12)},
  note         = {author: \zht{朱世傑} (pinyin: Zh{/=u} Sh{/`i} Ji{/'e});
                  Many many thanks to Po-Ning Chen (Chinese: \zht{陳伯寧}, pinyin: Ch/'en B/'o Ni/'ng) for his consultation with regards to the translation of the book title:
                  ``Originally, '\zht{鑑}' is a basin or container made by metals. 
                  It can then be used as a mirror after pouring water into it, 
                  and hence is extended to indicate a book that reflects faithfully about a subject. 
                  '\zht{玉}' is a precious stone and hence can be translated as Jade. 
                  The combination of the two characters is therefore translated as 'The Jade Mirror'."---Po-Ning Chen (\zht{陳伯寧}), 2012 September 12)},
