Just as Plato pointed out that rhetoric is
one of the arts\citetblt{\citerp{plato1875}{320}},
so Norbert Wiener pointed out that mathematics is also
one of the arts.
And as in all the arts, value is not primarily measured by
the measure of utility in real world applications,
but by the measure of beauty that it helps create.

Mathematics is not simply a collection of definitions and equations.
Rather it is a carefully built \emph{structure} of \emph{connected} concepts.
And the purpose of this text is to present the foundations of mathematics
in a {\em structured} and {\em connected} manner.

That is, we start with the most basic and fundamental concepts,
and build upon them other structures.
But critical to any structure is the connections between components.
As pointed out by Hardy, the value of a mathematical concept is not primarily in
it's applicability to real world problems,
but rather in how well it is connected too and helps connect other mathematical concepts.

The twentieth century was the century of abstraction in mathematics.%
\footnote{This concept of generalization so prevelant in 
twentieth century mathematics was well described by Van de Vel:
``It is typical of an axiomatic approach not to emphasize what an object \emph{\bf represents},
but rather how it \emph{\bf behaves}."---\citerp{vel1993}{3}

  \item In 1893, Heinrich Weber introduced the algebraic \hie{field}, 
        a generalization of the real numbers and associated arithmetic.

  \item In 1900, Richard Dedekind introduced \hie{modularity}, a generalization of
        \prop{distributivity}.

  \item In 1906, Maurice Ren\'e Fr\'echet
        introduced the concepts of the \hie{abstract space} as well as the 
        \hie{metric space}, which generalize concepts in analysis involving 
        convergence.

  \item In 1914, Felix Hausdorff introduced the modern concept of the 
        \hie{topological space}, a further generalization of the 
        already very general metric space.

  \item In 1922, Stephen Banach introduced the \hie{normed linear space},
        a generalization of operations involving integration.

  \item In 1929, John von Neumann introduced the \hie{Hilbert space}, a 
        generalization of earlier work by Hilbert involving integral operations.

  \item In 1948, Garrett Birkhoff introduced the \hie{lattice},
        a generalization involving partially ordered sets.
\end{liste}

This text presents the most general and abstract structures first,
followed by progressively more specific structures.
The idea is, that we try to prove as much as possible in the most general setting;
and then we only need to prove that a specific structure is a special case of the general
structure and hence can simply \hie{inherit} the properties of that general structure
without having to prove everything all over again.

It is general abstract concepts that allows us to easily see the connectivity
between multiple mathematical ideas and to more easily develop new ideas.
However, it is concrete specific examples that often make a general abstract concept clear
and more easily remembered in the future; and it may be argued that it is the concrete
examples that give the general abstract concepts meaning and significance.
This text provides many concrete examples that will hopefully greatly clarify
the more general concepts;
and will hopefully also help give value to the abstract concepts.

  Mathematics is a very old art form.
  Archeologists have found thousands of mathematical tablets among the ruins of the ancient
  Babylonians, buried in the sand for 4000 years but still readable (by some) today.
  Mathematics has for centuries been held in esteem because of its ability to
  solve practical problems.
\end{minipage}
Before the century of generalization---the twentieth century---and the 
century of precision---the nineteenth century---came several centuries of 
applications.
In fact, mathematics came to enjoy one of its finest hours during the
European Renaissance.
During this time, mathematics was brought to bear by so many to solve so many
extremely practical problems.
One of the most famous examples is Isaac \prop{Newton},
who demonstrated that the motion of objects
as small as an apple to as large as a planet could be accurately expressed and
(more importantly) accurately predicted by the analytical power of the calculus.
\hie{Peter the Great} of Russia, even though he himself did not
know too much about mathematics,
kept \prop{Euler} as a member of his court to work on the solution of very
practical problems. Peter the Great even referred to Euler,
at least in the beginning, as {\em My Professor}
(later, as the relationship became strained, he referred to Euler as
{\em My Cyclops}---Euler only had one good eye at the time).

website.\footnote{\url{http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Timelines/WhoWasThere.html}}
Note the following:
\begin{liste}

\item The number of mathematicians starts to exponentially increase at 
about the time of Gutenberg's invention of the printing press---
that is, when information of discoveries and results could be widely and economically 
circulated.\footnote{This point is also made by Resnikoff and Wells in\\
\citerp{resnikoff}{9}.}

\item There is another increase after the invention of the slide rule in the early 1600s---
that is, when computational power increased.

\item There are huge increases around the time of the first and second industrial revolutions---
that is, when there were many {\bf applications} that called for mathematical solutions.

\item After the invention of the pocket scientific calculator in 1972 
and home IBM PC in 1981---machines that could 
often make hard-core mathmatical analysis unnecessary in real-world applications---
there was a huge drop in the number of mathematicians.

\end{liste}

The point here is, that however little some mathematicians may think of 
real-world applications,
historically it would seem that applications are critical to 
how well mathematics thrives and develops. 
When mathematics is needed for the development of applications, 
mathematics prospers.
But when mathematics is not viewed as critical to those applications
(such as after the introduction of the personal computer), 
mathematics withers.

  \paragraph{Dual structure writing style.}
  Mathematician \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steenrod}{Norman E. Steenrod}
  proposed a mathematical style of writing
  in which there is a distinction between
  ``the {\em formal} or {\em logical} structure consisting of definitions, theorems,
  and proofs, and the complementary
  {\em informal} or {\em introductory} material consisting of motivations, analogies,
  examples, and metamathematical explanations."\citep{steenrod}{1}
  This is the style that largely characterizes this text.
  The overall development is in the definition-lemma-theorem style,
  which seems to be a reliable way to impose rigor on the development.
  The motivation and general discussion are in the more informal style,
  which helps give an intuitive understanding.

  More specifically, my guidelines for the informal portions of text are as follows:
  \begin{dingautolist}{"C0}
    \item The text should be terse rather than verbose.
    %\item The text should not be cluttered with supporting background
    %      mathematical material.
    %      Most all such material is placed in appendices at the end of the text.
    \item Key points are often indicated by enclosure in boxes---
          red double boxes for definitions, blue single boxes for theorems,
          curved-corner boxes for examples.
          This makes parsing key points faster and more efficient---
          allowing you to easily distinguish between key results, detailed proofs,
          and general discussion.
    \item Examples will be explicitly worked out, giving readers
          confidence that they really understand the material.

%Aubrey, John (1626-1697)
%[About Thomas Hobbes:]
%He was 40 years old before he looked on geometry; which happened accidentally. Being in a gentleman's library, Euclid's Elements lay open, and "twas the 47 El. libri I" [Pythagoras' Theorem]. He read the proposition . "By God", sayd he, "this is impossible:" So he reads the demonstration of it, which referred him back to such a proposition; which proposition he read. That referred him back to another, which he also read. Et sic deinceps, that at last he was demonstratively convinced of that trueth. This made him in love with geometry.

  \paragraph{Formal structure.}
  Guidelines in writing the proofs include:
  \begin{dingautolist}{"C0}
    \item Proofs should be very detailed (verbose rather than terse).
          This could tend to obscure the points the proofs are proving
          (``can't see the forest for all of the trees");
          but placing these points in boxes helps remedy this situation
          (see previous discussion).
    \item Every step that relies on another definition or theorem
          should be justified immediately to the right of the step,
          with cross referencing information.
          Many times these references include page numbers for more convenient access.
          If you happen to be viewing the pdf version of this text,
          then you can simply click on a particular reference and your pdf viewer will
          take you immediately to that location.
    \item Proofs, whenever possible, should be {\em direct proofs}
          clearly linking statement to statement with nothing more than
          the equality relation ($=$).
          They should not be cluttered with extensive explanations
          between steps. Let the mathematics speak for itself instead
          of me constantly jumping in waving my hands about in an effort to
          make clear what the mathematical equations make clear
          themselves.
    \item The development of proofs should rely fundamentally on
          propositional logic(logical AND $\land$, logical OR $\lor$, and logical NOT $\lnot$)
          and predicate logic (``for all" universal quantifier $\forall$ and
          ``there exists" existential quantifier $\exists$.)
  \end{dingautolist}

%Although countless practical problems were solved in the eighteenth century
%by the mathematical framework available,
%some began to see that this framework, howbeit sufficiently useful,
%was not sufficiently rigorous to withstand the scrutiny of rigorous logic
%and not sufficiently general to  support the most general functions.
%The nineteenth century was the century of analysis for mathematics.
%Thus with the arrival of the nineteenth century came also the arrival of
%the analytic mathematical samurais such as Cantor, Dirichlet, Lebesgue, and Weirstrass.
%These were men given to detail and who established mathematics on a detailed
%and solid mathematical
%footing through intense and thorough analysis.
%In the end Cantor lost his mind; but the world gained a mindset
%of a solid mathematical
%foundation on which new mathematical structures could be built in the
%twentieth century.

I have tried to include information that gives readers an understanding of where
concepts came from in the history of mathematics.
In some cases, the original source is given as a reference.
In some cases, you can download the source text for free if you have an internet
connection. Web link addresses are provided in the bibliography.
Besides references,
sometimes I have also included quotes from famous mathematicians that
influenced mathematical thinking at the time when a mathematical idea was developing.
These quotes normally appear as
\shadowbox{``shadow boxes"} in the text.

In providing such information from notable mathematicians, you the reader can
