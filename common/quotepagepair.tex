    Between the sea and land, \\
    What shall I build or write \\

    That hold the bursting wave, \\
    Or bastions to design \\
    For longer date than mine.

  {The uninitiated imagine that one must await inspiration in order to create.
   That is a mistake.
   I am far from saying that there is no such thing as inspiration;
   quite the opposite.
   It is found as a driving force in every kind of human activity, 
   and is in no wise peculiar to artists.
   But that force is brought into action by an effort, 
   and that effort is work.
   Just as appetite comes by eating so work brings inspiration, 
   if inspiration is not discernible at the beginning.
   %But it is not simply inspiration that counts:
   %it is the result of inspiration---

  {As I think about acts of integrity and grace,
   I realise that there is nothing in my knowledge to compare with Frege's dedication to truth.
   His entire life's work was on the verge of completion,
   much of his work had been ignored to the benefit of men infinitely less capable,
   his second volume was about to be published, and upon finding that his fundamental assumption
   was in error, 
   he responded with intellectual pleasure clearly submerging any feelings of personal disappointment.
   It was almost superhuman and a telling indication of that of which men are capable if their
   dedication is to creative work and knowledge instead of cruder efforts to dominate and be 
   known.}

\qboxns{Translated note written in Czech found in a World War II Nazi fired shell, one of eleven
in the fuel tanks of the B-17 bomber ``Tondelayo", that somehow made it safely back to base
instead of bursting into flames over Kassel, Germany---all the shells 
being devoid of explosive charge.\footnotemark\hspace{1ex}
In like manner, perhaps this text in some small way may help someone find success in accomplishing a task 
with significant returns to the well-being of humanity.}
