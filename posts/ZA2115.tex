I am having difficulty coming to terms with the [Rexnord ZA-2115 bearing](https://www.rexnord.com/products/za2115) technical specifications. This bearing is used in the [*NASA Bearing Dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayak123tyagi/bearing-dataset) where the Rexnord bearings are tested at 2000 RPM under a 6000 pound load. My questions in particular are:

(A) The *Vibration Frequency Fundamental Train*, *Inner Ring Defect*, *Outer Ring Defect*, and *Roller Spin* values are specified as 0.0072, 0.1617, 0.1217, 0.0559 cps, respectively. I might assume these are somehow [related to](https://books.google.com/books?id=_2RXEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA358) *Fundamental Train Frequency* (FTF), *Ballpass frequency outer race* (BPFO), *Ballpass frequency inner race* (BPFI), and *Ball spin frequency* (BSF).<br>
$\begin{array}{lcl|}
FTF &=&\frac{R}{2}\left(1-\frac{d}{D}\cos\phi\right)\\
BPFO&=&\frac{nR}{2}\left(1-\frac{d}{D}\cos\phi\right)\\
BPFI&=&\frac{nR}{2}\left(1+\frac{d}{D}\cos\phi\right)\\
BSF &=&\frac{DR}{2d}\left[1-\left(\frac{d}{D}\cos\phi\right)^2\right]
\end{array}$
where $n$ is the number of balls, $R$ is rotational speed, and $\phi$ is the contact angle.


<br>
But how do I get (and/or should I be able to get) from the Rexnord values to the (FTF, BPFO, BPFI, BSF) 4-tuple? Do I need to multiply Rexnord values by shaft rotational frequency? For example, is 0.0072 x RPM/60 equal to FTF in Hertz?

(B) How can I determine the number of rolling elements in ZA-2115? Since BPFO and FTF only differ by a factor $n$, then I might think that $n$ should equal BPFO / FTF (regardless of RPM). However, when I calculate 0.1217 / 0.0072, I get approximately  16.9 ... shouldn't I get an integer? Or are the values derived empirically using actual test data and a PSD?
