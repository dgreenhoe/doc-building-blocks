I would agree with @PierreCarre that it would be better to optimize with respect to $(N_*,a_0)$
in $\Bbb{R}^2$ rather than selecting 
a "reasonable" value for $N_*$ and only optimizing with respect to $a_0$ in $\Bbb{R}^1$.
I'm adding two more methods below---one that optimizes with respect to $(N_*,a_0)$, 
yielding a result compatible with that of @PierreCarre, 
and a third method that optimizes with respect to $(N_*,N_0,a_0)$ in $\Bbb{R}^3$.
I have also added a "Method 1..." title my previous post.
