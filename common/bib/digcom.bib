  abstract     = {The basic concepts and building blocks in multirate digital signal processing (DSP), including the digital polyphase representation, are reviewed. Recent progress, as reported by several authors in this area, is discussed. Several applications are described, including subband coding of waveforms, voice privacy systems, integral and fractional sampling rate conversion (such as in digital audio), digital crossover networks, and multirate coding of narrowband filter coefficients. The M-band quadrature mirror filter (QMF) bank is discussed in considerable detail, including an analysis of various errors and imperfections. Recent techniques for perfect signal reconstruction in such systems are reviewed. The connection between QMF banks and other related topics, such as block digital filtering and periodically time-varying systems, is examined in a pseudo-circulant-matrix framework. Unconventional applications of the polyphase concept are discussed.},
