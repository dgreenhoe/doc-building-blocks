This report discusses 
\fncte{negation} functions constructed on \structe{lattice}s,
\fncte{implication} functions constructed on \structe{lattice}s, 
and \structe{logic} systems constructed on \structe{lattices with negation and implication}.
Mathematical structure and properties of lattices are presented in \pref{app:order},
including special types of lattices such as \prope{bounded}, \prope{distributive}, \prope{modular},
\prope{Boolean}, and \prope{orthocomplemented} lattices.
