                  frontispiece, 1975.—This synopsis of the history and role of rai or stone money of
                  Yap within the culture of the islands has been drawn from the accounts of early
                  travelers, anthropologists, and administrators in the Western Pacific. The descriptions,
                  quarrying practices, and shipping methods of these stones are discussed, as well
                  as some of the "myths" that have grown up around these large primitive media of
                  exchange. Early and more recent "exchange values" of the stones are traced within
                  the islands, as well as in the international numismatic world.
                  The location and pertinent data of 149 pieces of stone money removed from
                  Yap and now in public and private collections throughout the world are provided
                  within the table for reference and comparison of sizes, dates and history of accession.
                  Sixty-four stones are illustrated, providing one of the most thorough studies of Yapese
                  rai now available.},

  abstract     = {In 1926, before skirt lengths inched above the knee and before anyone was ready to accept that a woman could test herself physically, a plucky American teenager named Trudy Ederle captured the imagination of the world when she became the first woman to swim the English Channel. It was, and still is, a feat more incredible and uncommon than scaling Mount Everest. Upon her return to the United States, "Trudy of America" became the most famous woman in the world. And just as quickly, she disappeared from the public eye. Set against the backdrop of the roaring 1920s, Young Woman and the Sea is the dramatic and inspiring story of Ederle’s pursuit of a goal no one believed possible, and the price she paid. The moment Trudy set foot on land, triumphant, she had shattered centuries of stereotypes and opened doors for generations of women to come. A truly magnetic and often misunderstood character whose story is largely forgotten, Trudy Ederle comes alive in these pages through Glenn Stout’s exhaustive new research.},
